# SFP+ Back2Back

This is a simple board to connect two SFP/SFP+ modules together.

So far it has only been tested with 10G fiber transceivers.
While it should work with other 1G and 10G (and maybe even 25G) modules and DACs too, I have not tested it with those (and I know that DACs tend to be more of an issue with such passive adapters/extenders).
